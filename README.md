## About
Level Imposter is the world's first custom Among Us map maker. It modifys the Among Us files in order to store custom assets, rooms, tasks, and sabatages. As fun as the original four maps are, we feel like giving the community the ability to create their own maps would make Among Us much more entertaining for everyone involved.

## Installation

1. Close Among Us
2. Download a Map file. Some are available [here](https://levelimposter.net/Map).

4. Click "Browse" and select the Map.zip you downloaded.
